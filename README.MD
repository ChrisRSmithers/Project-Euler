# Project Euler progress

This repository is to track my progress on the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) across a number of different languages.

## What isn't this repo?

Originally the idea was to showcase my coding ability, as well as learn as much as possible. I had previously published my actual code and results without realising the explicit prohibiting of this by Project Euler. Project Euler is a fantastic resource for problems for budding mathematicians and software engineers (and pretty much everyone!) and, whilst I am clearly under no legal obligation to do so, I have decided to refrain from publishing results. You will not find any answers, nor the means to find them in this repo.

## So what will you find?

I have decided to upload the following

* A record of my progress for each language; both the problems solved and the performance of my results
* Where applicable, a top level prototype of my solution (illustrating the ways in which my solutions are configurable)
* Unit tests for my code, which include a number of corner cases **but not the actual question on Project Euler**

If you have found this page for recruitment purposes, I will provide source code on request if asked via the private email address you **should** have
